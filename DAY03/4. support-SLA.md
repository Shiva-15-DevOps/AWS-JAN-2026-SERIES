# AWS Support Plans & SLA 

---

## 1. What is SLA (Service Level Agreement)?

A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** defines the **commitment from a service provider** regarding **response time, resolution expectations, and availability** when customers raise support requests.

In AWS support context, SLA mainly focuses on **how quickly AWS responds**, not on guaranteed fixes.

---

## 2. Types of SLA in AWS Support

AWS support cases follow **two important SLA concepts**:

---

### Response SLA

Response SLA indicates **how quickly AWS acknowledges and starts working on a support case** after it is raised.

Example:

* If a ticket is raised at 10:00 AM
* AWS responds by 11:00 AM
  → Response SLA = 1 hour

---

### Resolution SLA

Resolution SLA refers to **how long it takes to fully resolve the issue**.

Important clarification:

* AWS **does not guarantee resolution time**
* AWS guarantees **response time only**
* Resolution depends on issue complexity, architecture, and customer actions

---

## 3. AWS Support Coverage Categories

AWS support requests fall into **two broad categories**.

---

### 3.1 Account & Billing Support (Free for Everyone)

This category is **available to all AWS accounts**, regardless of support plan.

Includes:

* Account activation issues
* Billing questions
* Credit-related queries
* Bill disputes
* Account ownership transfer
* Invoice clarification
* Payment failures

Support channels:

* Phone
* Email
* Chat

Availability:

* 24x7

> Even accounts with **Basic Support** get full billing and account assistance.

---

### 3.2 Technical Support (Depends on Support Plan)

This category includes **technical help for AWS services**, such as:

* EC2
* S3
* RDS
* VPC
* IAM
* Load Balancers
* Networking
* Performance and availability issues

Access to technical support **depends on the support plan** enabled in the AWS account.

---

## 10. Support Plan Applicability (Very Important Concept)

---

### AWS Organizations (Enterprise / On-Ramp)

## 11. Trusted Advisor Access by Support Plan

| Feature            | Basic   | Developer | Business | Enterprise |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Core Checks        | Limited | Limited   | Full     | Full       |
| Cost Optimization  | ❌       | ❌         | ✅        | ✅          |
| Security Checks    | ❌       | ❌         | ✅        | ✅          |
| Performance Checks | ❌       | ❌         | ✅        | ✅          |
| Fault Tolerance    | ❌       | ❌         | ✅        | ✅          |

---

## 12. Important Clarifications (Teaching-Safe)

* AWS **does not fix your application bugs**
* AWS **guides and assists**, customer executes
* SLA applies to **response time**, not guaranteed fix time
* Support plan **does not replace good architecture**
* Budget overruns are **customer responsibility**

---

## 13. Summary

AWS Support Plans define:

* **Who can raise tickets**
* **How fast AWS responds**
* **What level of technical help is available**
* **Whether proactive guidance is provided**

Correct support plan selection depends on:

* Environment type
* Business criticality
* Number of AWS accounts
* Risk tolerance
